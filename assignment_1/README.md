model.py contains unigram, bigram and trigram models and related methods.
utils.py contains main methods to extract sentences from file
constants.py contains regex

ps : I've got error from trigram in 69. line but I've never got it again.
It just fix after second run. So I could not be able to debug it.

So if you got an error please rerun the program. :)
